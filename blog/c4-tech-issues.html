        <h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
        <h2>Issues in Tech</h2>
        <h4>2/5/15</h4>

          <p>Net Neutrality is an idea that all companies and individuals should be given equal access to the Internet. Internet providers such as Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast have suggested that they would like to charge big companies such as Google and Netflix, for more bandwidth and faster service. This could also lead to individuals needing to pay extra for accessing different parts of the internet.</p>
          <h3>Has this always been an issue?</h3>
          <p>In 1996, the Telecommunications Act was released which promoted competition in telecommunication providers to ensure low prices and high quality. Due to a technicality, a federal court decided that this does not apply to internet providers in January 2014. The FCC will be voting on a new act on February 26th, 2015.</p>
          <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
          <p>Without regulation, providers can analyze or manipulate our data. This means that they can change what we are allowed to view on the internet depending on who is paying them the most money. The ACLU had a great analogy: "Imagine if the phone company could mess with your calls every time you tried to order pizza from Domino's, because Pizza Hut is paying them to route their calls first."</p>
          <p>Without Net Neutrality, smaller internet companies would never be able to compete with bigger, older companies. There is no way a company starting out would be able to pay for the same kind of service as Netflix or Google.</p>
          <h3>So how do we fix this?</h3>
          <p>The FCC will vote on February 26th. They recently made a proposal with the “strongest net neutrality rules ever.” Hopefully, this will not be an issue much longer.</p>
          <p>However, one of the underlying factors leading to a need for Net Neutrality laws is the monopoly that Internet providers have. Most Internet providers have their own “territory” that they cover which eliminates competition. I have two ideas about how to solve this problem: 1. Government ownership of Internet infrastructure, similar to their ownership of physical infrastructure such as roads or 2.  A tax break reward to companies coming up with different ways of providing internet connection.</p>
