        <p>Making a website was a mixed experience for me. I generally have trouble with things that are visual or open ended, and this project was both! However, the more time I spent on it, the more I enjoyed working on it. </p>
        <p>While working on this website, I developed a lot of strategies that I think will be important in the future. Once mistake I made was pushing changes to the website before I was absolutely positive I wanted those changes pushed. I've learned to wait to push changes for as long as possible.</p>
        <p>I've also learned a lot more about what is difficult when making a website. When I decided I wanted a translucent backdrop behind my blog posts, I assumed it would take me a long time to figure out how to do. But small things that seem fancy generally take one command. What is truly complicated is formatting and positioning. How different objects respond to each other can be hard to predict without experimentation and research.</p>
        <p>While I don't know that front end work will be my passion, I definitely enjoyed creating this website.</p>
