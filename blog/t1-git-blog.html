      In this blog post I will describe version control, git, github and how they relate to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control systems allow users to save many versions (or commits) of their files for later use and reference. As described by DBC, commits are like checkpoints in a video game; if something goes wrong, you can just go back to that place in time. This is incredibly helpful because after you commit a file, if you ruin it later on, you can go back to a still working version. Another great aspect of version control is that it allows several people to work on the same document at the same time without saving over each other’s work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a popular version control system. Git allows you to keep track of your changes by saving a record of all of your commits in a helpful tool called “Git log”.

      GitHub is very similar to git except it exists on the Internet instead of on your computer. GitHub is also a social networking site. By putting your code on GitHub, it becomes accessible to other programmers who can then use, edit, share and learn from your code. GitHub and similar sites are important to the open source community.
