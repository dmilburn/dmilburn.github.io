        <h1> My Experience with Stereotype Threat </h1>
        <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
        <h4>2/17/15</h4>

        <section>
          <p>Stereotype Threat, a term coined by Claude M. Steele is where a person's ability and/or performance is judged based on the stereotypical achievement of a group of which they are a part. People are often most susceptible to stereotype threat when they are in an environment where they are viewed as an other.</p>
          <p>I have felt stereotype threat as a woman. When I meet people, both men and women, for the first time, they generally assume I'm dumb. Their assumption usually becomes more clear once they've changed their minds. Once someone sees I'm smart, there's a change that occurs;  people start to make a different kind of eye contact, their voice becomes less soft and they listen to me more.</p>
          <p>This is something that happens constantly. Knowing I need to prove myself to people has just become a part of life. I don't hold it against people who make assumptions about me. They are just one of a crowd.</p>
          <p>I think it will be difficult transitioning to being a part of a male dominated industry such as tech. I know that people will assume that I'm a diversity hire and don't deserve to be there. It will be a constant struggle to be seen as capable. </p>
          <p>The only way I know how to make an environment more welcoming is to go in and prove myself and that is what I plan on doing.</p>
