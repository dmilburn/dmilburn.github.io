    <p> Anthony Gregorc, Ph.D. Mind Styles model breaks down human thinking ability into two categories: how we process information (randomly or sequentially) and what kind of data we are processing (concrete or abstract). While all humans use every kind of thinking at some point, the test I took measures what thinking style I use most often. My test results were a perfect tie between Abstract and Concrete Sequential. </p>
    <p>Being tied between Abstract and Concrete Sequential thinking means I enjoy thinking in an orderly, logical way. These results made so much sense to me because I am a mess without a to do list (much like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqbR2FzXJBQ>toad"<a>). </p>
    <p>Understanding my favorite thinking style has helped me learn at DBC. In order to succeed I’ve learned that it’s very important for me to have a plan about how to go about my work. Every Sunday before the week starts I make myself a daily plan for the upcoming week. The built in planning into the DBC curriculum has already helped me learn quite a bit. I really appreciate that there is an orderly way to follow the different lessons and finish at the end of the week.</p>
    <p> My biggest struggle at DBC has been something I’ve struggled with in other areas of my life as well. I am very hard on myself when I make a mistake.  To fix this, every time I make a mistake I yell “Yay, learning opportunity!” It feels pretty silly but good. I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t do that in public, however.</p>
    <p>After researching growth and fixed mindsets, I discovered that I tend to have a fixed mindset. I would like to figure out how to think about things in a more random way. One approach I could take would be to experiment more; just type code in and see what happens. </p>
