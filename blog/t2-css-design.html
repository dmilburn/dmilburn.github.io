  <h1> What does it mean to change an object's display to "block", “inline” and “inline-block”? </h1>

  <section>
    <p> In CSS formatting, changing the display element changes how an object is displayed on the screen. Here is the correct CSS syntax for using <span class = bold> display</span>: </p>
    <div class = "code"> <p class = "code">.example { </p>
      <p class = "code">display: value;</p>
      <p class = "code">}</p></div>
    <p>Today I will explain the differences between <span class = bold> block, inline </span> and <span class = bold> inline-block display </span> values.</p>

    <h3>Block Objects</h3>
    <p>The "physical" measurements of <span class = bold> block </span>objects are changeable. In the example below, there are 3 <span class = bold> block </span> value elements: Mustard, Ketchup and Relish. These 3 elements are all different sizes; they all have different <span class = bold> height </span> and <span class = bold> width </span> values. </p>

    <p>The location of <span class = bold> block </span> objects is also changeable. By default, <span class = bold> block </span>objects stack themselves in a verticle line, like Mustard and Ketchup in the example below. Relish has been moved down and to the right using <span class = bold> margin-top </span> and <span class = bold> margin-left </span>.</p>

    <h3>Inline Objects</h3>
    <p><span class = bold> Inline objects</span> are displayed in a horizontal line. <span class = bold> Inline</span> objects do not have physical properties in the same way that <span class = bold>block </span>objects do. An <span class = bold> inline </span> object cannot have a defined <span class = bold> height </span> or <span class = bold> width </span>; it will become just big enough to hold its contents. In terms of location, <span class = bold> inline </span> objects cannot be moved vertically, only horizontally. In the below example, all of the code is exactly the same as the first example, except that the display value has been changed to inline. Without changing anything else, the condiments have all become a smaller size and moved into a horizontal line. </p>

    <h3>Inline-Block Objects</h3>
    <p><span class = bold> Inline-Block </span>objects have similarities to both <span class = bold> inline </span>objects and <span class = bold> block objects </span>. In the example below, I have again only changed the <span class = bold> display  </span>value to <span class = bold> inline-block </span>. Like <span class = bold> blocks, inline-blocks </span> can also have "physical" attributes; you can set the height and width. Notice in the example below that the three condiments are different sizes.</p>
    <p> Like <span class = bold> inline objects, inline-block </span>objects are in a horizontal line. Also similarly to <span class = bold> inline </span>objects, you can move objects horizontally but there are limitation on the vertical movement. Notice in the example below that the three condiments are in a horizontal line, starting from vertical position of Mustard.</p>
