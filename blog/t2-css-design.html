  <h1> What does it mean to change an object's display to "block", “inline” and “inline-block”? </h1>
  <h2>Condiments are delicious</h2>
  <h4>1/21/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p> One element involved in CSS formatting is changing the "display" property.  Display effects how an object is displayed on the screen. Here is the correct CSS syntax for using “display”: </p>
    <p><code>.condiments { </p>
      <p>display: block;</p>
      <p>}</code></p>
    <p>In the above code, you can see the word "block" after "display". “Block” is one of many different display properties that one can use in designing websites. Today I will explain the differences between "block", “inline” and “inline-block” displays.</p>

    <h3>Block Objects</h3>
    <p>When an object is displayed as a block, all of its "physical" measurements are changeable; you can change its size (height, width) and its location in space(margins). In the example below, there are 3 objects with block display: Mustard, Ketchup and Relish. Using "width" and "height" I was able to specify an exact size for each condiment. </p>

    <p>By default, block objects stack themselves in a verticle line, like Mustard and Ketchup in the example below. Relish has been moved down and to the right using margin-top and margin-left.</p>

    <h3>Inline Objects</h3>
    <p>One makes objects inline in order to display them in a horizontal line. Inline objects do not have physical properties in the same way that block objects do. An inline object cannot have a defined height or width; it will become just big enough to hold its contents. In terms of location, inline objects cannot be moved vertically, only horizontally. In the below example, all of the code is exactly the same as the first example, except that it has been set to display: inline; instead of display: block;. Without changing anything else, the condiments have all become a smaller size and moved into a horizontal line. </p>

    <h3>Inline-Block Objects</h3>
    <p>As the name suggests, objects defined as inline-block have features similar to both inline objects and block objects. Like blocks, inline-blocks can also have "physical" attributes; you can set the height and width. Like inline objects, objects that are inline-blocks move to be in a horizontal line with each other. Also similarly to inline objects, you can move objects horizontally but there are limitation on the vertical movement. In the below example, each of the condiments are different sizes and can be found in a horizontal line.</p>
