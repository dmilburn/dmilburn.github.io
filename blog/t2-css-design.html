  <h1> What does it mean to display “inline” vs. “inline-block”? </h1>
  <h4>1/21/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>HTML and CSS are programming languages used in designing websites. HTML is what you use to display the content of the website and CSS is what you use to change the formatting, color and everything involved in making websites pretty.</p>
    <p> One element involved in CSS formatting is changing the "display" property.  Display effects how an object is displayed on the screen. Here is the correct CSS syntax for using “display”: </p>
    <p><code>.awesome_possum { </p>
      <p>display: block;</p>
      <p>}</code></p>
    <p>In the above code, you can see the word "block" after "display". “Block” is one of many different display properties that one can use in designing websites. Today I will explain the differences between "block", “inline” and “inline-block” displays.</p>
    <p>For my explanations, I will manipulate the code and images seen here:</p>
    <h3>Inline Objects</h3>
    <p>Objects that are "inline" move to be in a horizontal line with each other. An object that is "inline" cannot have a defined height or width. The object will become just big enough to hold its contents and the developer cannot directly affect its size. In the example below,.....</p>

    <p>You can move inline objects vertically by changing their top and bottom margins, but their right and left margins cannot be changed so you cannot move them side to side. In the example below,.....</p>

    <h3>Block Objects</h3>
    <p>When an object is displayed as a "block", all of its "physical" measurements are changeable; you can change its size (height, width) and its location in space(margins). Another feature of blocks is that they automatically have a line break between them and the next object. In the example below,......</p>


    <h3>Inline-Block Objects</h3>
    <p>As the name suggests, objects defined as inline-block have features similar to both inline objects and block objects. Like blocks, inline-blocks can also have "physical" attributes; you can set the height and width of inline blocks. Like inline objects, objects that are inline-blocks move to be in a horizontal line with each other. Also similarly to inline objects, you cannot adjust the right and left margins of inline-blocks, only the top and bottom margins; therefore, you can only directly move inline-blocks up and down, not left and right. In the example below,......</p>
