      This video of Shereef changed my impression of Dev Bootcamp. What Shereef said about “Kitchen vs. Restaurant” makes a lot of sense and made me cognizant of times when I have had a restaurant attitude in my life. I realize now that it makes everyone’s job harder to “expect to be served” and that to get the most out of a situation requires curiosity and self-motivation. I’m really not sure how I will engage with the DBC culture. I’ve learned how to exist well within a traditional school culture; throwing those rules out of the window feels both exciting and terrifying.  I’m looking forward to trying my best and seeing how it goes.
