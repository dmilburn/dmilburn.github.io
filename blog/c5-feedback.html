    <h3>Peer Pairing</h3>
    <p>I've really enjoyed Peer Pairing so far. I love working in teams. My favorite part of being a violinst was playing in a string quartet. I love working in a small team towards a common end.</p>
    <p>I love how natural it is to help and learn from each other when you're pairing. Everyone has different strengths and you get to know them so well when you're working with someone.</p>
    <p>My favorite part of any pairing session is the feeling when the code finally works after you've been struggling together to fix it. It always feels a little bit like magic when code works correctly and it's nice being able to share that with someone who's equally excited.</p>
    <p>What's been most frustrating for me in peer pairing is when we're not a good driver/navigator match. Since everyone sees these roles differently, it's hard to be perfect puzzle pieces unless both people are trying to adjust. I'm wondering if spending more time on the description of driving and navigating at the beginning may help save time and frustration throughout the session.</p>
    <p>Overall, I think pairing is a great way to learn. I've learned a lot of sublime shortcuts and methods from pairing. Pairing during Phase 0 also has the added benefit of allowing you to feel like part of the community before you've even arrived in person.</p>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>I was terrified to read my feedback the first time. I constantly think that I'm hurting other people's feelings so I was waiting for my feedback to reflect that. However, my feedback has overall been quite positive.</p>
    <p>The feedback I have received has been helpful in that it has reassured me that I'm doing okay. I have a tendency to assume the worst and receiving feedback that has largely been positive has been comforting. </p>
    <p>I have received three pieces of constructive feedback so far: re-evaluate before proceeding on an old plan, don't be afraid to research, and keep working to cement understanding. I've tried to work on these three things in my peer pairings and outside.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy writing feedback for my pairs. I like how writing feedback helps me to think about and appreciate their positive attributes. What I've found most difficult in writing feedback is wording constructive feedback kindly and specifically. Previously when I would try to be kind, I would often be unspecific. During quartet rehearsals if someone was out of tune, my go to would be to say "We need to work on our intonation" versus, "You're out of tune." It's been an interesting adjustment to be both kind and straight forward. </p>
    <p>I think feedback is an important part of learning and I'm glad it's a part of DBC.</p>
