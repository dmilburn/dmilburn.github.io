    <h3>Driver Test Code Question</h3>
    <p>I previously asked this question in the DBC google community: </p>
    <p>"I'm stuck on Release 2 of the Die Challenge this week "Translate the Tests". How do you create driver test code to test for ArgumentErrors?</p>

    <p>"Whenever I try to test whether something that should be an ArgumentError is one, it prints the error instead of "true", e.g.</p>

<p class = "code"> empty_array = []</>
<p class = "code">p Die.new(empty_array) == ArgumentError</p>

<p class = "code">=>my_solution.rb:52:in `initialize': A die without a side cannot be rolled.  (ArgumentError)</p>

    <p>"Thanks!"</p>
    <p>I think I did a good job phrasing it. It was a very specific problem which made it straight forward to ask. I followed most of the question rules provided by Jon Skeet: I included a small amount of code that showcased my problem and I explained what I wanted to happen and what happened instead. Since this question wasn't posted on stackoverflow, certain pieces of advice don't apply, such as posting a title. </p>
    <p>I received a helpful answer that completely solved my problem. </p>
    <h3>CSS question</h3>
    <p>I also posted this question in the DBC google plus community: </p>
    <p>"Hi all,</p>

    <p>"For the 5-CSS challenge, does anyone have a good solution for making line breaks in the header using CSS, not HTML?</p>

    <p>"The best I could come up with was creating a class for line breaks. I'm wondering if there's a better way. Thanks!ï»¿"</p>

    <p>This question was much less successful than my first example. I think there are several problems with it. Having not read this question for several weeks, it took me a while to understand what I was asking. I didn't say exactly what part of the problem I was trying to solve which isn't helped by my vague word choice of "line break". What do I want to do with my line break?</p>
    <p> I also didn't talk about my overall problem. I didn't say, I want to control how big the spaces are in between my lines of text. Nor did I talk about my process. I didn't say, I decided to try xyz and it resulted in abc instead of what I wanted, pqr.</p>
    <p>The answers that I received didn't completely solve my problem. I think that is greatly due to not having a fully formed understanding of my problem before asking.</p>
