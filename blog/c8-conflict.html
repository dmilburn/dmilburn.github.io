        <h1>Conflict and Resolution</h1>
        <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
        <h4>3/8/15</h4>

          <p>I was the second violinist in a semi professional quartet for two years. We were all good friends and got along well most of the time. In the middle of our time together, our quartet was chosen for a master class. Right before we were about to go on, the first violinist turned to me and said "Debbie, do your best, okay? Really play out. I want to hear you."</p>
          <p>While this comment seems innocuous now, at the time I found it incredibly jarring. As a violinist I suffered from bad performance anxiety. Performing was (and continues to be) a stressful and uspetting experience. Since we were just about to go out and perform, my anxiety was already peaked and this comment brought me over the edge. Performing was even harder for me that day than usual.</p>
          <p>Analyzing it now, the basic emotion I was feeling was fear. I was afraid of failing and having someone in effect say that they were also afraid of me failing made me more afraid.</p>
          <p>We got through the performance. It went fine despite my freak out. A week later I decided to talk to the first violinst about my fear and about what he said to me before the performance. He listened patiently and sympathetically. He explained that what he said to me was part of his own performing ritual. To calm his anxiety he likes to make sure everything is in place before he performs. Since I would often play softly when I was afraid, asking me to play loudly became part of his checklist. He promised to respect my needs and not ask me that before a performance.</p>
          <p>I picked this conflict because it is one I think I handled well. I have trouble letting people know when I'm upset and this is an instance of me facing that fear. What I learned from this experience was that sometimes people will hurt you by accident because they are having their own feelings and experiences. This conflict also helped me to believe a little more that it's okay to let people know you're upset.</p>
