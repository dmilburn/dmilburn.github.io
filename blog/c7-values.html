    <h3>Exercise 1: Which values relate to your happiest, proudest or most satisfying moments?</h3>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Accomplishment</li>
    <li>Close relationships</li>
    <li>Excitement</li>
    <li>Personal development</li>
    <li>Autonomy</li>
    <li>Serenity</li>
    <li>Achievement</li>
    <li>Challenge</li>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Order</li>
    <li>Self-reliance</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise 2: On a scale from 1-5, how much do you try to live up to these values?</h3>

    <p><ul>
    <li>Accomplishment = 5</li>
    <li>Close relationships = 5</li>
    <li>Excitement = 4</li>
    <li>Personal development = 5</li>
    <li>Autonomy = 4</li>
    <li>Serenity = 5</li>
    <li>Achievement = 5</li>
    <li>Challenge = 5</li>
    <li>Music = 1</li>
    <li>Order = 5</li>
    <li>Self-reliance = 4</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise 3: Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.</h3>
    <p>I've chosen to write about serenity. I've always had anxiety. Anxiety has caused strain on pretty much every part of my life. I have spent a lot of time learning how to manage my anxiety and about techniques to help me keep calm such as meditation, eating well and exercise.  Serenity is a constant and important pursuit for me and I hope to achieve it in everything that I do.</p>
    <h3>Exercise 4: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?</h3>
    <p>I will often get asked for advice on things related to organization or "order". I think organizing is an important skill and I enjoy being able to share it with others.</p>
    <h3>Exercise 5: How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>
    <p>Thinking about my values made me feel proud of some of the things I have accomplished and that I enjoy. I love organization and hard work. When I experience stereotype threat, feeling more comfortable with myself and my beliefs will definitely help. I think remembering my search for serenity, my loving support system and my ability to put my head down and work will always help me power through. </p>
    <p>I recently found the HeadSpace meditation app. I think the use of this app and mindfulness techniques will help me get through anything that happens at DBC.</p>
