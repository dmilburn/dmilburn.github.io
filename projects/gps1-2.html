I sadly didn't have a pair for my GPS session. I really enjoyed learning from Kenny however. This challenge wasn't difficult for me. At this point I feel fairly comfortable with HTML and CSS. I ran out of ideas about what to do so Kenny gave me some suggestions to make it more difficult. Like at one point he said to make columns like a newspaper which took some time to create. I didn't keep the changes and went back to the original idea. 

We (I...) spent [1] hours on this challenge.
